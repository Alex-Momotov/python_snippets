# Dataframe
Think of a dataframe as a container for multiple Series objects. Where those Series objects have same length.
Each column is a Series with values from 0 to N (number of records). First column is index.
Each row is a Series and can be identified by index number.

# Series
Series is a one-dimensional array. Think of series as rows of a single column of a dataframe.
Think of Series as a list, but with more functionality to it.

# Filters
Filter expressions return boolean arrays. Boolean arrays can be used to index dataframes and series.
